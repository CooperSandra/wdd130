        <p>Hello, my name is Sandra Cooper and I am from Freeport, Grand Bahama. The Bahamas.<br>
           I enjoy learning new skills. I'm currently studying Software Development at BYU<br>
           Pathway Connect as an online student. Art has always been a passion of mine, and through<br>
           software development I will be able to express my artistic abilities, while helping others<br>
           in my community to thrive. I don't know what the future holds, but i'm trusting in the one<br>
           who holds the future and looking forward to good things working within the industry.

      <h1>Sandra Cooper | WDD 130</h1>
      <img src="images/profile-sm.webp" alt="Hello my name is Sandra Cooper" width="200">
      <p> Hello, my name is Sandra Cooper, and I am proud to call Freeport, Grand Bahama, The Bahamas<br>
        my home. I have always been someone who thrives on creativity and learning, and that passion<br>
        has led me to pursue a path in Software Development. I'm currently studying online through<br>
        BYU-Idaho's PathwayConnect program, working toward expanding my skills and exploring the<br>
        many ways technology and creativity can come together.<br><br>
        Art has always been a meaningful part of my life. I find joy and peace in charcoal drawing,<br>
        watercolor painting, and sketching with various pencil shades, each medium allowing me to<br>
        express different layers of thought and emotion. Whether it's the soft smudges of charcoal or<br>
        the gentle flow of watercolor, creating art has helped me see the beauty in both simplicity and<br>
        detail. I hope to bring that same artistic energy into the software I build, crafting digital<br>
        experiences that are not only functional but also thoughtfully designed and inspiring.<br><br>
        Beyond my personal goals, I have a genuine desire to help others grow and thrive. Whether it's<br>
        through encouragement, sharing knowledge, or simply listening, I believe we all have something<br>
        valuable to offer. I don't know exactly what the future holds, but I choose to place my trust in <br>
        the One who does. With faith as my foundation and creativity as my compass, I'm excited for what<br>
        lies ahead in the world of software development and beyond.<br>

      <h2>The Bahamas</h2>
      <img src="images/grand-bahama.webp" alt="The Bahamas">
      <p>The Bahamas is a stunning chain of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Florida.
         Known for its crystal-clear turquoise waters, white-sand beaches, and laid-back island vibe,
         it's a place where time seems to slow down. Made up of over 700 islands and cays, though only
         about 30 are inhabited, it offers everything; from bustling towns like Nassau, to quiet untouched
         stretches of paradise. Rich in culture and history, The Bahamas is a melting pot of African, European,
         and Caribbean influences that is reflected in its music, food, and friendly people. Whether you're
         snorkeling over vibrant coral reefs, enjoying fresh conch salad by the sea, or just relaxing in the sun,
         every island feels like a true escape. The Bahamas, my home!</p>

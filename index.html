        <p>Hello, my name is Sandra Cooper and I am a native of Freeport, Grand Bahama, The Bahamas.<br>
           I enjoy learning new skills; currently I'm studying Software Development with BYU Idaho through<br>
           Pathway Connect as an online student. Creativity has always been a passion of mine, and I<br>
           would like to express my artistic abilities through software development. Additionally, helping<br>
           others to thrive is also a desire. I don't know what the future may hold, however, my trust<br>
           is in the one who hold the future. Looking forward to good things within the software industry.

      <h2>The Bahamas</h2>
      <img src="images/the-bahamas.jpg" alt="The Bahamas">
      <p>The Bahamas is a stunning chain of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Florida.
         Known for its crystal-clear turquoise waters, white-sand beaches, and laid-back island vibe,
         it's a place where time seems to slow down. Made up of over 700 islands and cays, though only
         about 30 are inhabited, it offers everything; from bustling towns like Nassau, to quiet untouched
         stretches of paradise. Rich in culture and history, The Bahamas is a melting pot of African, European,
         and Caribbean influences that is reflected in its music, food, and friendly people. Whether you're
         snorkeling over vibrant coral reefs, enjoying fresh conch salad by the sea, or just relaxing in the sun,
         every island feels like a true escape.<br>The Bahamas, my home!</p>
